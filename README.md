Welcome to my **Semester 3** repository! ðŸŽ¯  
This repo contains my solutions to **ADSA** (Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms) assignments, practice problems, and **Python** challenges solved from **HackerRank** and **LeetCode**.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  
- **ADSA/** â†’ Codes related to **Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms** (Semester 3 coursework + practice).
- **Python/HackerRank/** â†’ Python problem solutions from **HackerRank**.
- **Python/LeetCode/** â†’ Python problem solutions from **LeetCode**.

---

## ðŸ›  Topics Covered  

### **ADSA**
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & BSTs
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- Sorting & Searching
- Recursion & Backtracking

### **Python (Hackerrank + LeetCode)**
- Basic to Advanced Python programming
- Problem-solving patterns
- Data structure implementations in Python
- Algorithm challenges

## ðŸš€ How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Imdilshan/Sem-3.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder:
   ```bash
   cd ADSA/Array
   ```
3. Run Python codes:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
4. Run C++ codes:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```
   
ðŸ“Œ **Notes**  
- These are my personal solutions from Semester 3 â€” they may not be the most optimal in all cases, but are functional and tested.  
- Feel free to fork and improve them.  
- Some solutions may have multiple approaches for learning purposes.  


 ðŸ’¡ **Future Plans**  
- Add time & space complexity analysis for each ADSA problem.  
- Add unit tests for Python solutions.  
- Organize problems by difficulty level.
